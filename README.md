## Getting started
There are three separate codebases to this project. The `Frontend`, `Backend` and the `Electron Desktop` app. 

Each codebase is located in it's corresponding folder `frontend/`, `backend/` and `desktop/` of the project's root directory.

And for each codebase, there's a `README.md` file with instructions on how to set it up.
